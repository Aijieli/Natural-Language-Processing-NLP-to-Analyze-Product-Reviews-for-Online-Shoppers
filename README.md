# Natural Language Processing (NLP) to Analyze Product Reviews for Online Shoppers

The main business objectives for the project are:
- to reduce dimensions while retaining as much information as possible using principal components for "bag-of-words"
- to predict product ratings based on explicit reviews, using ordinal logistics regression
- to recommend products to online shoppers based on similarity algorithm (Euclidean)

## Data Characteristics
- reviewerID - ID of the reviewer, e.g. A2SUAM1J3GNN3B
- asin - ID of the product, e.g. 0000013714 
- reviewerName - name of the reviewer 
- helpful - helpfulness rating of the review, e.g. 2 out of 3 people found the review to be helpful. The starter code’s dataframe would have 2 in the helpful_start column and 3 in the helpful_end column 
- reviewText - text of the review 
- overall - rating of the product 
- summary - summary of the review • unixReviewTime - time of the review
