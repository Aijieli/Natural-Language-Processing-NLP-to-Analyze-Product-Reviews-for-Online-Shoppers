# Review-Rating-Prediction

The main goals for the project are:
I started working on this project towards 3 business objectives:
to find principal components on the ratings, using NLP unsupervised machine learning
to predict product ratings based on explicit reviews, using NLP supervised learning
to recommend products to online shoppers based on purchase history, using some similarity algorithm

## Data Characteristics
- reviewerID - ID of the reviewer, e.g. A2SUAM1J3GNN3B
- asin - ID of the product, e.g. 0000013714 
- reviewerName - name of the reviewer 
- helpful - helpfulness rating of the review, e.g. 2 out of 3 people found the review to be helpful. The starter code’s dataframe would have 2 in the helpful_start column and 3 in the helpful_end column • reviewText - text of the review • overall - rating of the product • summary - summary of the review • unixReviewTime - time of the review
